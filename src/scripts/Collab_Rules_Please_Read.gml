///Collaboration Rules for those who wish to help me on this game:

/*
    In general, you are only allowed to help on the project if you were given 
    permission to do so by giga6152 (myself and the leader of the project).
    
    You are permitted to add your own resources to this game as long as they are put
    in the appropriate folder of each tab in the resource tree. You are required to
    use the following naming convention when doing so:
    e.g. sprGameArt (it must follow with an underscore followed by your username so
                    I know who made the resource).
    Anything without this naming convention cannot be changed or modified at all as 
    all of those resources belong to giga6152 (me).
                    
    You are only allowed to add resources. You are prohibited from modifying or 
    changing any resources that do not belong to you.
    
    You can, however, look at code from an existing object and copy it into your own code if 
    you are not sure how to do it, you must get special permission from me first.
    
    Also, you may not delete any resources that are not your own.
    
    You may make new folders and put resources in them, as long as they are in the 
    appropriate folder (the folders must also contain your name in them).
    
    Additional rules:
    
    You may not add paths or included files into the project. If you wish to add 
    shaders or timelines, you must get permission from me to do so. You are still 
    required to use the same naming convention for other resources.
    
    When making sound resources, you are only allowed to add SFX. You are not 
    allowed to add your own music or change any music code as I am happy with the 
    music that I have chosen. If you want to add music, you must get special 
    permission from me first.
    
    You may not make any fonts as I am happy with the fonts that I have chosen.
    
    You are also prohibited from adding any constants to the game.
    
    If I find any breaches to the project rules, I will give you a strike and I will
    undo any breaches that you made. Get three strikes and you will be banned from 
    the project.
    
    NO OFFENSIVE SPRITES OR OTHER MATERIAL ALLOWED. DO SO AND YOU ARE INSTANTLY BANNED 
    FROM THE PROJECT, I'M NOT JOKING.
    
    ANYONE CAUGHT DISTRIBUTING THE GAME SOURCE TO ANYONE WITHOUT MY APPROVAL GETS AN 
    AUTOMATIC BAN FROM THE PROJECT.
